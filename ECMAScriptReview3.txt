React and TypeScript Review Exercise see https://pastebin.com/6p6iJk3T
==================================== until about 3:00
Generate a new ReactJS App using the typscript template
  npx create-react-app weather-app --template typescript

Provide controlled fields where the user can enter a city (2 or more characters) and a country (2-3 characters only)
Bind these to values in the application state, with sensible defaults

Make a fetch request based on these parameters e.g.
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=london,uk&units=metric&APPID=4e8da6e9040e437ae6dd1cfc888f170c
(Note the APPID key which is good for 60 requests per minute)

If you like, make an initial weather request when the page first loads (using componentDidMount life-cycle event)
(NB life-cycle events are only available on Class-based components)

Present the weather description and temperature in the view, using something like this:
  this.state.result.weather[0].description
  this.state.result.main.temp

Optional
--------
Show other data values, such as wind speed and direction, and geo lat/lon
Use data types for variables and function return types
Also data-type collections, using interfaces and/or classes as you need
Decide when to use class-based components and when to use function-based components
Persist each search in an array along with a time-stamp. Show this data in a component
Consider writing individual style sheets for each component (remember, App.css will leak into child components)
