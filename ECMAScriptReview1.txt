ECMAScript Review Exercise 1 about half an hour ish
============================ see https://pastebin.com/4Ss23fjP
Use this API end-point to show images based on what users enter into a form field:
	https://graph.facebook.com/billgates/picture?type=normal

NB works for 'billgates', 'mickeymouse', 'pluto' etc.

Details
- create a new web page for this
- link the script to a separate file
- put an image and any form fields and buttons you want on the page
- find a way to update the image src as the user types in the field
- decide if you need a <form> tag for this
- make decisions about your code style, aiming for clean, performant code

Optional
- Offer an option to persist a successful image (and add a new image to be controlled)
- every time the form field value changes store the value in localStorage
- When the page first loads, retrieve any value from localStorage and pre-populate the field with that value
- Explore whether there is any difference in how the page behaves when running locally (c:) or via a web server (npx http-server)
