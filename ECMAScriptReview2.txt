ECMAScript Review Exercise 2 see https://pastebin.com/YbNX4EFY
============================ for about an hour - until 3:35 ish
Begin a new React App. Delete the default content in App.js
Provide two form fields, one for 'category' and one for 'id'
Category can be people, planets, vehicles, starships or species and id is a number from 1-6
Bind the form fields to stateful properties of the component (use class-based component)
Also provide a button with an event handler

Clicking the button should populate props (cat and id) which you will inject as props to another component
This child component should use the 'cat' and 'id' values to make a request to https://swapi.dev/api/cat/id
 - This will be fetch(.....).then().then()

In the second 'then' you will have the returned data as text. Find the 'name' property and show it in the component

Optional
--------
Conditionally render other bits of information
So for example 'people' have eye-color and 'planets' have rotational period etc.
When the results come back, list each film as hyperlinks. Clicking a link should fetch the data about that film and show relevant info in another component
Handle API errors (e.g. vehicle number 4) elegantly
Only enable the button if both fields are filled in
